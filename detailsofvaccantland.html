    <p>Farm and ranch specialists have long been quite successful in the real estate business. It is important to understand the specific buying requirements and motivations of prospective buyers and sellers. Generally, the property size and price are quite large, with corresponding commissions. 

        In rapidly growing areas, specializing in building lots for properties can be lucrative for an agent. Just know that as long as the building pace continues, the area you have to cover will inevitably move further out from the city and possibly your office.
        
        Vacant land in some areas commands a higher commission percentage, though this is decreasing in frequency. As land prices and values have increased, few validations exist for higher commissions. The listing and transaction process is significantly simpler and there are no structural inspections, floor plans, or insurance issues to address. So commissions have largely leveled off with other property transaction commissions. </p>
    <p>Historically, an estate comprises the houses, outbuildings, supporting farmland, and woods that surround the gardens and grounds of a very large property, such as a country house or mansion. It is the modern term for a manor, but lacks a manor's now-abolished jurisdictional authority. It is an "estate" because the profits from its produce and rents are sufficient to support the household in the house at its center, formerly known as the manor house. Thus, "the estate" may refer to all other cottages and villages in the same ownership as the mansion itself, covering more than one former manor. Examples of such great estates are Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, England, and Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, England, built to replace the former manor house of Woodstock</p>

<h2>In the United States</h2>
<hr>
<p>Large country estates were traditionally found in Long Island, Westchester County, Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island, and other affluent East Coast enclaves; and the San Francisco Bay Area, early Beverly Hills, California, Montecito, California and other affluent West Coast enclaves. All these regions had strong traditions of large agricultural, grazing, and productive estates modeled on those in Europe. However, by the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of these estates had been demolished and subdivided, in some cases resulting in suburban villages named for the former owners, as in Baxter Estates, New York.</p>
<p>An important distinction between the United States and England is that "American country estates, unlike English ones, rarely, if ever, supported the house."[1] American estates have always been about "the pleasures of land ownership and the opportunity to enjoy active, outdoor pursuits."[1] Although some American estates included farms, they were always in support of the larger recreational purpose.[</p>
<p>Today, large houses on lots of at least several acres in size are often referred to as "estates", in a contemporary updating of the word's usage. Most contemporary American estates are not large enough to include significant amounts of self-supporting productive agricultural land, and the money for their improvement and maintenance usually comes from fortunes earned in other economic sectors besides agriculture. They are distinguished from ordinary middle-class American houses by sheer size, as well as their landscaping, gardens, outbuildings, and most importantly, recreational structures (e.g., tennis courts and swimming pools). This usage is the predominant connotation of "estate" in contemporary American English (when not preceded by the word "real"), which is why "industrial estate" sounds like an oxymoron to Americans, as few wealthy persons would deliberately choose to live next to factories.</p>

<h2>Checklist To Buying Land/Plot In India</h2>
<hr>
<ul type="circle">
    <li><strong>Ensure That The Seller Actually Owns The Land</strong></li>
    <div>Even if it is love at first sight with the sought after piece of land, it’s better to confirm if the seller/builder actually owns it before taking any hasty decision. </div>
    <div> have been numerous cases of fraud and you need to be really careful when it comes to these intricate details. Check if the seller has the legal rights of selling it.</div>
    <div> Ask them to show you the papers; don’t believe just their words! Don’t know much about this? Better get legal help.</div>
    <li><strong>Check If The Owner Opted For A Loan To Build That Project</strong></li>
    <div>You need to check with the owner to see if they had taken a loan to build the project on the piece of land. Don’t worry! If they have, that’s not a bad sign. The</div>
    <div> project has gone through legal checks and that’s why the bank would have granted the loan. Check if the loan has been repaid. If not, buying that piece of land </div>
    <div> get more complicated.</div>
    <li><strong>Check The Floor Space Index (FSI) Of Your Plot</strong></li>
    <div>Before starting the construction of your house, you obviously need to have a clear idea about on how much land can you actually construct there. To get that idea, </div>
    <div> need to enquire about the Floor Space Index (FSI) of the plot. It primarily depends on the location of the plot. For instance, even if you buy a large plot of land</div>
    <div> and the FSI is really less for that location, you won’t get to construct much and will basically end up wasting a lot of your precious plot space. You obviously </div>
    <div> don’t want that to happen, right?</div>
    <li><strong>Ask For The Non-Agricultural (NA) Order</strong></li>
    <div>Did you know that all land in India is agricultural land by default, unless the government has listed it for some other purpose? See! That’s why you need us! While </div>
    <div> a plot of land, it’s therefore absolutely essential to enquire if the plot you’re planning to buy is non-agricultural. Wait! That’s not it. Non-agricultural land </div>
    <div> many types—for commercial use, for resorts, for IT parks, for warehouses and for residential purpose. It’s obvious that you need to see if it’s okay for residential </div>
    <div> You don’t want to illegally occupy a piece of land and break the law, do you?</div>
    <li><strong>Check History Of The Land</strong></li>
    <div>In some states, it is essential that you check the ownership of the land in the past decade. The ownership should have been properly passed on and there should be no </div>
    <div> in between. This will help ensure that there are no disputes over the land in future.</div>
    <li><strong>Find Out When You’ll Get The Sale Deed</strong></li> 
    <div>Don’t merely trust the ‘agreement of sale’ document. It doesn’t prove that you’re a valid buyer – it just signifies that the buyer and the seller have both agreed to </div>
    <div> terms and conditions. You, therefore, need to get the sale deed, which is a legal proof of the sale. To get it, you need to register the sale in the sub registrar’s </div>
    <div> Once that’s done, you become the legal owner of your plot.</div>
    <li><strong>Calculate The Annual Maintenance Charges Of The Plot</strong></li>
    <div>Your work doesn’t end with buying the plot and getting the sale deed – you also need to pay for the maintenance of the plot/building. Why? For the upkeep of various </div>
    <div>like gardens, water, security etc. Now that you know of these, it’s better that you calculate them beforehand.</div>
    <li><strong>Is The Plot Well Located?</strong></li>
    <div>One of the most important things that you need to look out for is the location of the plot. You might have the idea of reselling the plot in future. To get a good </div>
    <div> value, the plot needs to be well located. Also, don’t forget to check if the plot is located on a flat piece of land! You don’t want small hills on your plot, right?</div>
    <li><strong>Check For All The Basic Amenities</strong></li>
    <div>Before signing the sale deed, you must check if all the basic amenities are available or not. These include water, electricity, the roads around, security and fencing </div>
    <div>the plot. You want your future house to have a reliable power supply and good connectivity to the city.</div>
